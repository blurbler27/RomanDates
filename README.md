# RomanDates
Web page and javascript for writing dates ancient Roman style.

For fun, I'm trying to learn some Latin through self-study and some on-line courses (Satura Lanx in particular.)  Due to the rather complex way the ancient Romans had of specifying dates (e.g., January 30 would be three days before the Kalends of February (even though it's really only two days)) I found it helpful for me to write a  little  Javascript function to understand the system.  I have posted here an html file using this function in case anyone else finds it of interest.  Advice and corrections are welcome.
I'm terrible at writing beautiful web pages, so this is rather bare-bones.
